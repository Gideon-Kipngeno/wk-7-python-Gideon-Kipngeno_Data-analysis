## Week 7 Assignment: Analyzing Data with Pandas and Visualizing Results with Matplotlib

#  Sales Data Analysis with Python

This project is part of my PLP Academy journey, where I apply Python to real-world data analysis and visualization. Using a sample sales dataset from Kaggle, I explore key business metrics, clean and analyze the data, and generate annotated visualizations to uncover trends and insights.

---

##  Project Overview

- **Dataset**: `sales_data_sample.csv` (Kaggle)
- **Tools Used**:
  - `pandas` – data manipulation and analysis
  - `matplotlib` – static visualizations
  - `seaborn` – enhanced statistical plots
- **Objectives**:
  - Load and clean the dataset
  - Perform descriptive and grouped analysis
  - Visualize trends, distributions, and relationships
  - Annotate key insights directly on plots

---

## File Structure

- sales_analysis.py # Main Python script with analysis and visualizations 
- sales_data_sample.csv # Dataset used for the project 
- README.md # Project documentation

---

##  Visualizations Included

1. **Line Chart** – Sales trends over time  
2. **Bar Chart** – Average sales by product line  
3. **Histogram** – Distribution of unit prices  
4. **Scatter Plot** – Quantity ordered vs. sales amount  

Each chart includes annotations to highlight peak values, medians, and top-performing categories.

##  Key Insights

- **Deal Size Impact**: Larger deals consistently yield higher average sales  
- **Product Line Performance**: Some product lines outperform others significantly  
- **Price Distribution**: Most unit prices cluster between $60–$100  
- **Sales Trends**: Clear seasonal patterns and peak periods are visible

##  How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
 ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Gideon-Kipngeno/wk-7-python-Gideon-Kipngeno_Data-analysis.git
   cd wk-7-python-Gideon-Kipngeno_Data-analysis
 ```
Install required libraries:

   ```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
 ```
Run the script:

   ```bash
python sales_analysis.py
 ```
## Learning Outcomes
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing

2. Grouping and aggregation with pandas

3. Plot customization and annotation

4. Error handling for robust scripting
